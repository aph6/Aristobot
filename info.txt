To get started simply type ``!register`` to register yourself as a player in the league.

You will be assigned a default rating of 0 to begin with. To see more information about yourself or other members just type ``!user [member]``.  This will show you 4 numbers:
1. Your rank in the league which is based on your rating
2. Your rating which is calculated from your skill and uncertainty level
3. Your skill which is based on the games you win and lose
4. Your uncertainty which is based on how many games you've played (lower is better)

You can report match results with the commands ``!report1v1`` for a simple 1v1 or ``!matchreport`` which will let you report ANY type of match (2v2, 3v3, 5v2, 1v6...etc.).
View the league table with ``!leaderboard`` or ``!lb``.

Anyone can report matches so this system is very much based on trust.

Type ``!help`` for a full list of commands
